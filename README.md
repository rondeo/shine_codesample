# Welcome to Shine! ðŸŒŸ

The purpose of this project is to connect students with excellent teachers.

Eventually, we would like to provide search recommendations that match you with people who "get" you, right away.

## Project Goals

- maintain Rails views for admin-only views; React for user-facing views

## Project Milestones

- V0: Tutor can apply, Parent can request a Tutor
- V1: Parent can select own tutor on-site, Parent can Hire tutor, Tutor can Report Lesson and be paid

## Development Process

Release Process:
- Please use feature branches
- Any commits to master should be deployable

Estimation:
- 0 points: 30minutes - 1 hour
- 1 point: 1 hour - 4 hours
- 2 points: 4 hours - 8 hours
- 3 points: 1+ days (if possible, break down into smaller stories)


## Development

### Dev Setup

1. `bundle`
1. `yarn install`
1. `foreman start -f Procfile.dev-server`

### Deployment

Hosted on Heroku. No prod DNS yet.

- [https://shine-stg.herokuapp.com/](https://shine-stg.herokuapp.com/) - auto-deployed on push to `master`
- [https://shine-prod.herokuapp.com/](https://shine-prod.herokuapp.com/) - manually promoted via [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/f9a280ed-7e82-4b5a-b9ed-99b447f59ce1)

#### Debugging Deploys

- delete public/assets if it is compiled locally; Heroku detects the Sprockets manifest in `public/assets/.sprockets-[fingerprint]` to decide whether to compile the assets (ie run webpack compile) on deploy. If it sees the manifest, it skips compiling Webpack

### ReactOnRails setup

ReactOnRails has been useful for development, particularly for the flexibility of using Rails views where possible. It also provides server-side rendering. It's not the best documented, though; here are some docs.

- [How it Works (Technical Explanation)](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails#how-it-works)
- [Documentation Gitbook - Whoo!](https://shakacode.gitbooks.io/react-on-rails/content/)

### ReactOnRails - Adding a new Component

Long story short, you have to expose your React components to Rails to have them passed into the `react-on-rails` JS helper (NPM package)
