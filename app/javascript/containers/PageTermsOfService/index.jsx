        <p>Welcome to ShineTutors.co (the “Website”), an online marketplace operated by Tutorbook, Inc. (hereafter “us” “we” “our” or “Tutorbook”) connecting students (“Students”) with a network of independent contractor instruction providers (hereafter “Providers” or “Provider Members”). This Terms of Use (the “Agreement”) binds you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”) to the terms and conditions set forth herein when you use or access the Website or any of our software, applications, sites, materials, products, tools and other offerings (collectively, the “Services”). If you wish to use our Services, you must read, comply with and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you object to anything in this Agreement, do not use our Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement is an electronic contract that sets out the legally binding terms of your use of our Services, whether or not you register as a “Student Member” or “Provider Member” (each may be referred to as a “Member”). This Agreement includes our Privacy Policy, Student and Provider Policies, our billing policies and any further terms of use for our Services, which are all incorporated herein by reference. This Agreement may be modified by us from time to time, such modifications to be effective when provided in writing or upon posting within our Services. Certain parts of our Services may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of or within our Services, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that specific Service, but this Agreement shall still apply to our legal relationship. You have the right to receive this Agreement in non-electronic form, either before or after you electronically sign the Agreement, by sending a written request and self-addressed stamped envelope to: Tutorbook Inc., 1482 California St, San Francisco, California 94109.

Any access to or use of our Services by anyone under the age of majority is expressly prohibited and requires consent to this Agreement by a parent or legal guardian. By using our Services, you represent and warrant to us that you are either a legal adult or, if under the age of majority, have obtained proper consent from a parent or legal guardian.

          3. How the Service Works
        </h2>
        <p>
          We are an online marketplace for Students and a network of independent contractor Providers. We do not endorse, hire or employ the Provider Members nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between Provider Members and their respective Student Members or between Members. Our Services are separate and distinct from the services of Provider Members.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Provider Members, we offer various hosted products to support instruction including marketing, scheduling, billing and communication tools. Provider Members can also apply to use our Services where prospective Students can review their profile, communicate with Provider Members and book and pay for lessons and other services ancillary thereto (called a "Listing").
        </p>
        <p>
          For Student Members, we provide a marketplace to find a network of independent contractor Provider Members and schedule lessons and other services ancillary thereto. Users may be able to review Listings as an unregistered user of our Services; however, if you wish to book a lesson as a Student, to create a Listing as a Provider, to use hosted tools or use certain Services, you must first become a registered Member. See the “How It Works” section of the Website for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time, we may provide new or temporary Services, such as on demand tutoring, group lesson or classes and other products, materials and services that may or may not be limited to Members. We reserve the right to restrict any Services only to Members and discontinue any product or Services at will. If a particular Provider, product or Service is discontinued or unavailable, we reserve the right to provide substitute Provider, product or Service.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Membership</h2>
        <p>
          You may use some of our Services at no direct cost. However, in order to access additional features and Services, including the ability to book or manage lessons, you must become a registered Member. To become a Member, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete throughout your use of the Services. A Member may not have more than one active Tutorbook Account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Tutorbook Account and your access to our Services for any reason.
        </p>
        <h3>a. Student Membership.</h3>
        <p>
          As a Student Member, you will have the ability to book and pay for lessons, manage your lesson schedule, communicate with Providers, access help documents and use any other Services provided to Student Members.

        <h3>b. Provider Membership.</h3>

Any Listing you post (i) must not breach any agreements you have entered into with anyone, including this Agreement; and (ii) must contain accurate, current and complete information. If you are accepted and your Listing is presented within our Services, you must continually comply with this Agreement and the Provider Policies set forth here. Any Provider Member who accepts a booking through our Services must honor all terms and conditions of the Listing, this Agreement and any our additional Provider Policies in effect at the time of booking. As part of your Provider Membership, you will be required to receive messages via text / SMS and may incur costs from your carrier or mobile service provider as a result of these messages.

        <h3>c. Independent Contractor Status.</h3>
        <p>
          Our Services are separate and distinct from the services of the Providers.

As such, we do not endorse or control the Providers, the manner or method of service to you, exercise no control over your working relationship with the Provider Member and do not warrant your safety or the service of any Provider Member. We urge all users of our Services to be responsible and careful about their use of our Services, any transaction entered into as a result of our Services and interactions with Members.

        <h2>6. Payment and Refund Policy for Individual Tutor Seekers.</h2>
        <p>
          Student Members are obligated to pay for the service of the Site, unless specifically notified otherwise. Student Members that sign up agree to pay Tutorbook all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Site.

If a Student Member continues their subscription after the end of the free trial period, the Student Member will be charged the price then in effect for a monthly subscription to the Service. To avoid being charged for the service of the Site, a Student Member with a free trial subscription must cancel their subscription prior to the end of the free trial period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subscriptions of Student Members will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate, unless specifically notified otherwise. To cancel your subscription, contact Tutorbook Member Care or edit your account settings. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.

        <p>
          No refunds or credits will be provided for account cancellation requests received after the account has been billed. In addition, no refunds will be granted for any donations to third-party organizations that are made while enrolling or using the Site. At Tutorbook's sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by Tutorbook.
