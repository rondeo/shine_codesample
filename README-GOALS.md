## Automated tasks

This project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) to run automated tasks for development and production builds.
The tasks are as follows:

`npm run dev`: Compiles preprocessors and boots up development server
`npm run build`: Will run all production tasks so you can view the site/app in it's final optimized form

`gulp test`: Lints all `*.js` file in the `source` folder using eslint

***Adding the `--debug` option to any gulp task displays extra debugging information (ex. data being loaded into your templates)***
